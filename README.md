# Youtube comments sentiment analysis and topic-modeling

The motivation behind this project was the removal of the dislike button on YouTube, which led to a decrease in user feedback for videos. The idea was to provide users with quick insights into a video's reception through comment analysis. To achieve this, I developed sentiment analysis using the NLTK library. Additionally, I implemented topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to help users identify the main topics of discussion in the comments.
